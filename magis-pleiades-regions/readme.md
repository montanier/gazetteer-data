# Polygons for Pleiades Regions

These polygon geometries were digitized from Barrington Atlas rasters (georegistered and supplied by the
[Ancient World Mapping Center (AWMC)](http://awmc.unc.edu/)) by Pedar Foss at Depauw University in 2007 for the
[MAGIS project](http://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/). The data was made available by Pedar Foos for free redistribution,
with attribution (Copyright AWMC & Foss, CC-BY).

With support from the [Pelagios project](http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.uk), [Stuart Eve](http://www.dead-mens-eyes.org/) 
has added Pleiades identifiers and converted the geometries to GeoJSON format.
